# Research

This section contains info about trying approaches and libraries.

Each section should have what is considered to add/update/remove, why, and the
final decision. Was it adapted or abandoned and why.

# Use existing python FSM library
## Adding
Parse states into existing FSM library.
A good candidate is [Python State Machine](https://python-statemachine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The project is active on [Github](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine).

## Why
Most interesting features for us are:
- Implemented States, Events, and Transitions
- Conditional transitions
- Existing validations
- Graphical representation support

The problem with the lib is that it is designed for running the state machine
in Python. In our case we need to validate it and convert it into C code.
C code generator can be a separate module that takes internal representation
based on the FSM lib. Another module can provide extra validations by cycling
through the states in Python. This also fits with the [optimization](./plans.md#optimizations-of-output-code) idea.

## Final decision
TBD
